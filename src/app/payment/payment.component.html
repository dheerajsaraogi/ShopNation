    <h4><u>Shipping</u></h4>
    <h6>What are the delivery charges?</h6>
    <p>Delivery charge varies with each Seller.</p>
    <p>Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases, charging a nominal delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs. Please check your order summary to understand the delivery charges for individual products.</p>
    <h6>What is the estimated delivery time?</h6>
    <p>Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product page. Business days exclude public holidays and Sundays.</p>
    <p>Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Seller offering the product</li>
            <li>Product's availability with the Seller</li>
            <li>The destination to which you want the order shipped to and location of the Seller.</li>
        </ul>
    <h6>Why is the CoD option not offered in my location?</h6>
    <p>Availability of CoD depends on the ability of our courier partner servicing your location to accept cash as payment at the time of delivery.</p>
    <p>Our courier partners have limits on the cash amount payable on delivery depending on the destination and your order value might have exceeded this limit. Please enter your pin code on the product page to check if CoD is available in your location.</p>
